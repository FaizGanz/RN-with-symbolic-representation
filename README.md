# FiLM: Relation Networks with Symbolic Representation

## Faiz Ganz, Jesse Huang, Thejus Hari Krishna Rao

Pytorch implementation of Relational Networks - [A simple neural network module for relational reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf)

Implemented & tested on Sort-of-CLEVR task. (original code [here](https://github.com/kimhc6028/relational-networks))

Trained also on a symbolic representation of the object realtions expressed as a table.
