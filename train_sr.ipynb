A solution to this problem is the implementation of Relational Network modules throughout the selected base architecture.\n","\n","A Relational network is a neural network module that is used to model relational reasoning. The idea behind Relational networks is to use general-purpose components (MLPs) so that we can capture the patterns of relational properties and use them to augment the network architecture by modulating the upstream representations (feature maps).\n","\n","RN Module:\n","\n","$RN(O) = f_ϕ(\\sum_{i,j} g_\\theta (o_i, o_j))$\n","\n","The input to the Rn module is the set object $O = \\{o_1, o_2, ..., o_n\\}$, where $o_i ∈ \\mathbb{R}^m$. The functions $f_\\phi$ and $g_\\theta$ are simple MLPs with parameters $\\phi$ and $\\theta$. For each pair of objects $(o_i, o_j)$ the function $g_\\theta$ is tasked with inferring their relationship in an order invariant manner. Because the module is made with general purpose components it is end-to-end differentiable. There is no specific requirement for what an object can be, hence relatively unstructured inputs such as CNN or LSTM embeddings can be used as objects.\n","\n","In reality however, the RN quesiton dependent. Hence the correct formulation is $a = f_ϕ(\\sum_{i,j} g_\\theta (o_i, o_j, q))$.\n","\n","For the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset, the model used does not contain an LSTM portion. The questions are encoded as binary strings embeddings of fixed size which are passed directly to the RN module in combination with the object representations.\n","\n","The model consists of four convolution layers with 32, 64, 128, and 256 kernels coupled with ReLU activation functions and batch-normalization. The RN module is made up by a four layer MLP with 2000 neurons per layer for the function $g_\\theta$ and a four layer MLP with 2000, 1000, 500, and 100 neurons respectively for the function $f_\\phi$.\n","\n","The model is topped with a final classification layer and trained using CE loss and an Adam optimizer with learning rate of $1e-4$.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4lb4_Hg_W37L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 2: Model
